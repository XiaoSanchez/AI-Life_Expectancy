# Artifcial Intelligent: Life Expectancy Prediction by Machine Learning

This project trained a Linear Regression model to predict life expectancy. The dataset was initially obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Websites. Data contains features such as year, status, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, percentage of expenditure, and alcohol consumption.
## Appendix

In this project, the main focus are the following objectives:

- the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.

- python libraries, dataset and perform data visualization

- exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.

- Trained and Evaluated linear regression model using Sci-kit Learn library.

- regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2

- the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.

- the distribution and relationship of data.
